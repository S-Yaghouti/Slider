## Installation

### To integrate the image slider into your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the Files: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Serve the `index.html` File**: To view the slider in action, youâ€™ll need to run a local server. Here are a few options:

   - **Using Live Server**: If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Simply open the `index.html` file and click on "Open with Live Server."

   - **Using XAMPP**: Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Move the project folder to the `htdocs` directory, then start the Apache server from the XAMPP Control Panel. Access the slider via `http://localhost/your-folder-name/index.html`.

   - **Using Python**: If you have Python installed, navigate to your project directory in the terminal or command prompt and run:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```
     This will start a simple HTTP server, which you can access at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
